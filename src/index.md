# WCAG of the Day

## What is this?

Just like those "Word of the Day" email services you can subscribe to, this will send you a daily email with distilled info on a random [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG) success criterion.

## Why was it made?

I found (and still find) WCAG kind of hard to read and understand, and as a result I avoided trying to read it for myself.

This service was made to help keep me engaged in trying to understand the criteria directly, one at a time, and make them a little easier to grok too.

## How do I sign up?

## How can I give feedback?

You've got a few options:

- Reply to one of the daily emails
- [Tweet at or message me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/__grunet)
- [Chat or message me on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/__grunet)
- [Write up an issue on Github](https://github.com/Grunet/digestible-wcag)
